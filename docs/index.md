Hello, World! üåç
This is my homepage created with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
</p>

<p>
Originally, I looked into creating a website with Wordpress. However, it became evident that that was a bit overkill for what I wanted! As a developer by day, I'd consider myself quite with Github - and with no upfront cost, it's a great option to get started.
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping to use this blog to write book reviews, and encourage myself to reflect on what I actually read. Another benefit would be learning Jekyll! Once the blog is more established, I may consider moving away from a static site generator onto something more adventurous.
</p>
