<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>


<p>
Hello, World! üåç
This is my homepage created with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

Originally, I looked into creating a website with Wordpress. However, it became evident that that was a bit overkill for what I wanted!

As a developer by day, I'd consider myself quite with Github - and with no upfront cost, it's a great option to get started.

<!-- Pagination Links -->
